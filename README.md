# Contact Manager App - Project Brief

## Project Overview

A modern, responsive contact management application built with Next.js and React, featuring comprehensive CRUD operations, advanced sharing capabilities, and a clean, professional user interface inspired by Apple's design principles.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI components
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Data Storage**: Local Storage (client-side persistence)
- **Icons**: Lucide React


## Core Features

### 1. Contact Management (CRUD)

- **Create**: Add new contacts with multiple phone numbers and email addresses
- **Read**: View contact details with organized information display
- **Update**: Edit existing contact information seamlessly
- **Delete**: Remove contacts with confirmation


### 2. Advanced Sharing System

- **QR Code Generation**: Dynamic QR codes for instant contact sharing
- **Shareable URLs**: Web-based contact sharing with encoded data
- **SMS Integration**: Direct SMS sharing with formatted contact information
- **vCard Export**: Standard .vcf file generation for universal compatibility


### 3. Duplicate Management

- **Smart Detection**: Automatic identification of potential duplicates based on:

- Name similarity
- Shared phone numbers
- Shared email addresses



- **Merge Functionality**: Combine multiple contacts while preserving all data


### 4. User Experience Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time contact filtering
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion-powered transitions
- **Professional UI**: Clean, minimalist design with consistent styling

- Touch-optimized interface elements
- Adaptive button sizing and spacing


### 2. Advanced Sharing Implementation

- Dynamic QR code generation using external API
- URL encoding for secure data transmission
- Multi-format export capabilities (vCard, SMS, URL)


### 3. Smart Duplicate Detection

- Algorithm-based duplicate identification
- Flexible merging with data preservation
- User-controlled merge process


### 4. Performance Optimization

- Efficient re-rendering with React best practices
- Smooth animations without performance impact
- Optimized search functionality


## User Interface Highlights

### Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Clean, professional appearance
- **Consistent Branding**: Black and white color scheme
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear visual hierarchy
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
